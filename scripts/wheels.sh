Checking for common errors...

NOTE: Shared object (.so) files found in this project.

These files might be built against the wrong OS, causing problems with
auditwheel. If possible, run cibuildwheel in a clean checkout.

If you're using Cython and have previously done an in-place build,
remove those build files (*.so and *.c) before starting cibuildwheel.

setuptools uses the build/ folder to store its build cache. It
may be necessary to remove those build files (*.so and *.o) before
starting cibuildwheel.

Files that belong to a virtual environment are probably not an issue
unless you used a custom command telling cibuildwheel to activate it.

  Files detected:
    _cassarrow.cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
    build/lib.linux-x86_64-3.9/_cassarrow.cpython-39-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
